# purpose
Why does this group exist
Why? I believe that…
As heirarchy and centralization are stone age organization structures, presentation, status update, managed discussion, themed brainstorm, and open/unstructured discussion are stone age ways of organizing conversations to share thinking. It is really really hard to innovate coordinition in DAOs when you’re using stone age tools to have meetings

How? 
LS stand in contrast to this as as set of 33 open source tools for shared thinking and organizing conversations. As analog communication algos they have several properties that are relevant to address the coordination and trust building challenges of DAOs. Perhaps the most important are that they: 
Include and unleash everyone in conversations, as scale invariant methods.
Distribute the kind of facilitative leadership that guides conversations potentially to everyone in a group.

What? So I will… 
I’m building a bridge between the facilitation community of Liberating Structures(LS) Users and web3 through DAOs for commons/public goods (Since knowledge/skill with these tools represent a public good itself)

And Measure…
Here is where attestation comes into play. In order to onramp the existing global community of LS users AND assist anyone in web3 to learn LS, I want to use a combination of:
NFT’s (soulbonded, POAPs, value charged, ?) to assist users to document the LS Learning Journey so that they can keep track of their progress and recognize what there is still left to learn
AND
Use ATTESTATION of demonstrated learning to create non-deterministic agent-based records of identity so that we can establish credibility/proficiency while avoiding centralization/certification.
Together this will make visible:
who’s learning and how fast
how well/who’s using the tools
in the context of what relationships are they being used/learnt 
Which may be able to help us correlate/quantify/express the value using LS at different scales
Gamify/Tokenize and create an incentive landscape for learning and using LS

If I’m wrong…
No one will want to learn LS
No one will opt in to use the tooling to keep track of learning journey
The tooling will be used but exploited (and irrelevant/useless)
The incentivization will externalize motivation, be used but become a dick measuring competition/vanity metric (and fuck up the vibe)
